# Eye-Exercise
This project consist in having two circles with a big round black pointer that makes it look like two eyes. Every Black round pointers has a functionality that it will follow the mouse once the mouse gets into the browser.

How to Run:
  Download all files in the repository.
  Open the Index.html
  Hover the mouse on the browser
  You will notice the eyes will follow the mouse pointer everywhere it moves.
  
Roadmap of future improvements: 
  I am considering to make the eyes close if you click on it and then reopen if you click it again.
